### Description

This is a boilerplate code I played with to learn about Docker, deployment and SSL encryption.

It covers:

- Building a simple React front-end using the Material-UI library
- Designing a Flask API that receives data from the front-end
- Setting up a domain name and an SSL certificate with Nginx
- Configuring an AWS instance with a static IP and a domain name
- Deployment using docker-compose

The goal is to learn how these components interact with each other.
